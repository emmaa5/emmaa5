## Hello, I'm Emma!
I'm a 23 year old brazilian trans woman and computer engineering student on her third year. I am very passionate about cybersecurity, so I've been studying it by myself, any advice is very valuable! I also do front end development with a hint of UX/UI design, I am primarly self taught, it's been 4 years since I started my coding journey, although I did tinker with Unity a year earlier, so maybe 5?
