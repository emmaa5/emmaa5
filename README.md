## Hello, I'm Emma!
I'm a 23 year old brazilian trans woman and computer engineering student on her third year. I am very passionate about cybersecurity, so I've been studying it by myself, any advice is very valuable! I am a self-taught front end developer, having 4 years of coding experience, although I did tinker with Unity a year earlier, so maybe 5?
